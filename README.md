#Do Things

An Alfred Workflow for controlling Things.app

***

##The Commands

So far, Do can only do 3 things:

1. Add a new task to the Inbox
2. Add a new task to "Today"
3. Log your completed tasks

To add a new task to the inbox, the command is

    do example task

To add a new task to the "Today" list, the command is

    do today example task

Alternatively, you can use the `do` command and hold the shift key to add the task to "Today"

To log the completed tasks, the command it

    do log

That's all for now, folks.

##Future Plans

Eventually, I really want Do to list all of the tasks in a particular list, even if it is only the Inbox and Today lists, but I'm not sure if I can do that in pure Applescript, and I don't know how to use any other languages to interact with Things.  However, if I figure it out, I'll definitely add more things to Do!
