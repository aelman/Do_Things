#Do Things

An Alfred Workflow for controlling Things.app

***

##The Commands

So far, Do can only do 3 things:

1. Add a new task to the Inbox or "Today" lists
2. List and completed the tasks in the inbox and "Today" lists
3. Log your completed tasks
4. Empty the trash

### The Inbox

To list the tasks to the inbox, the command is

    do inbox
    
Alfred will display the items in the inbox, and if you action one of them, it will mark the item as completed.

To add an item to the inbox, just keep typing! For example, the command

    do inbox example task
    
will add a task named "example task" to the inbox

### The "Today" List

The "Today" list works just like the "inbox" ones, just substitute "inbox" for "today", like this

    do today
    
or this

    do today example task

### Logging Tasks

To log the completed tasks, the command is

    do log

### Emptying the Trash

To empty the trash, the command is

    do empty
